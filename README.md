### Requirements

Install Docker on Ubuntu 14.04 LTE:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

Install Docker on Windows or Mac OS:

- Go to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- Download the Docker Community Edition (CE)

### Installation

TODO include steps for how to run container here

### Description

To create an easier user experience and workflow for Holberton Students while they go through the program.

Botbier aims to minimize frustrations with setting up the StarCraft II Learning Environment through improved documentation and containerization. By removing barriers to setup, this project allows developers to start creating StarCraft II agents in a matter of minutes.

### Goal

Dockerize [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) - Holberton's C code style checker

<!-- Our full project will do the following:

1. Pull the image from Docker on to your local machine.
2. Set up the Betty Docker container.
3. Create an alias for the command "Betty"
    - This command will start the Docker container if it's not started.
    - Send the file to containerized Betty service to process.
    - Run the Betty script on it.
    - Output Betty information.
 -->

#### Stretch Goals and Roadmap

- [ ] include PEP8 and Shellcheck using Docker Compose.
- [ ] make Betty Docker a web service.
- [ ] expand social media presence by creating Twitter account
- [ ] livestream team progress
- [ ] create GUI interface for Betty
